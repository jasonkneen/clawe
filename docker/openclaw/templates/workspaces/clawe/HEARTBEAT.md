2. Check if any agent is blocked
3. Check for tasks in "review" status
4. Check for notifications or mentions

## If Tasks in Review

When tasks are in "review" status:
1. Verify the deliverables exist
2. Check subtasks are all complete
3. Notify your human with task summary
4. Wait for approval before marking done

2. Triage new tasks — assign to appropriate agent
